# Scheduling Component Fix Tracking

## Current Issue
- Infinite loop occurring in Scheduling.tsx when starting scheduling process
- Loop causes repeated socket message sends for instruction updates
- Maximum update depth exceeded error in React
- Fields not being requested in the correct order (patient name should be first)
- Agent providing unwanted introductory messages instead of directly asking for patient name

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Voice command effect runs on messages change
2. Effect sends socket message when "scheduling" is detected
3. Socket message triggers re-render
4. Re-render causes effect to run again with same message
5. Cycle continues indefinitely
6. Field order not enforced in prompts and responses
7. Agent prompt not strict enough about initial response

## Required Changes

### 1. Voice Command Effect Fix
- Add check to prevent repeated processing of same message
- Track last processed message ID/timestamp
- Only process message if it hasn't been handled before

### 2. Socket Message Management
- Move socket message sending to a separate effect
- Add proper dependency array to control when socket messages are sent
- Ensure socket messages don't trigger unnecessary re-renders

### 3. State Management
- Review and consolidate state variables
- Ensure state updates are batched appropriately
- Add guards against unnecessary state updates

### 4. Field Order Enforcement
- Ensure patient name is requested first
- Add sequential prompts for each field
- Maintain proper order: name -> MRN -> type -> datetime -> duration -> notes

## Attempted Solutions & Results

### Attempt 1: Message Tracking (✓ Partially Successful)
- Added `lastProcessedMessage` ref to prevent duplicate processing
- Result: Helped with infinite loop but didn't fix field order issue

### Attempt 2: Socket Message Effect (✓ Successful)
- Removed separate socket message effect
- Integrated message sending into voice command handler
- Result: Reduced complexity and helped prevent loops

### Attempt 3: Initial Prompt Update (⚠️ Testing Needed)
- Modified schedulingPrompt to be much stricter:
  - Removed all introductory phrases
  - Added explicit instruction to only say "What is the patient's name?"
  - Added clear examples of expected flow
  - Enforced strict field order
  - Added explicit rules about never combining questions
- Result: Pending testing with latest changes

### Attempt 4: Remove Direct Instructions (✓ Important Fix)
- Identified issue with directly sending "What is the patient's name?" instruction
- Removed all direct instruction updates from component
- Let the agent's prompt handle all responses and field order
- Removed unnecessary socket message sending
- Result: Pending testing, but should fix the instruction override issue

## Progress Tracking

### [x] Initial Analysis
- [x] Identified infinite loop issue
- [x] Documented root cause
- [x] Created fix plan
- [x] Identified field order issue

### [x] Implementation
- [x] Add message tracking with lastProcessedMessage ref
- [x] Modify voice command effect to prevent duplicate processing
- [x] Add immediate patient name request
- [x] Add sequential field prompts
- [x] Update scheduling prompt to be more strict
- [x] Remove all welcome messages and introductions
- [x] Add explicit examples in prompt
- [x] Enforce strict field order in prompt

### [ ] Verification
- [ ] Test scheduling start
- [ ] Verify no infinite loop
- [ ] Check socket messages
- [ ] Validate field order
- [ ] Validate scheduling flow
- [ ] Confirm no welcome messages
- [ ] Test out-of-order input handling

## Next Steps
1. Test latest prompt changes
2. Monitor agent responses for compliance with new strict format
3. Verify field collection order
4. Test error handling and recovery
5. Document any remaining issues

## Latest Changes (2024-03-19)
1. Added `lastProcessedMessage` ref to track and prevent duplicate message processing
2. Modified voice command effect to immediately request patient name
3. Added sequential prompts for each field in the correct order
4. Removed separate socket message effect
5. Added proper field order: name -> MRN -> type -> datetime -> duration -> notes
6. Improved logging to track the flow of execution
7. Removed direct instruction updates that were overriding the agent's prompt
8. Let the agent's intelligence handle the conversation flow based on the prompt
